curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckyparihar3111-crypto/Startraders/main/complete-setup.sh | bash

# OR if above doesn't work, use this manual method:

# 1. Create the setup script
cat > ~/complete-setup.sh << 'EOF'
[SCRIPT CONTENT WILL BE HERE]
EOF

# 2. Make it executable
chmod +x ~/complete-setup.sh

# 3. Run it
./complete-setup.sh

# 🎯 What this script will do automatically:
# ✅ Install PM2
# ✅ Start backend with PM2  
# ✅ Configure NGINX
# ✅ Setup domain qxtrand.onrender.com
# ✅ Install SSL certificate
# ✅ Enable auto-renewal
# ✅ Test everything

# 📋 Requirements before running:
# 1. Domain DNS must point to 31.97.207.160
# 2. You must be in SSH terminal as root
# 3. Frontend build should be ready in ~/Startraders/client/build/

# 🆘 If any step fails, the script will stop and show error
